# A module is a file that contains Python code, such as functions,
# classes, or variables, that you can reuse in other Python 
# programs. Modules help organize code into smaller, manageable, 
# and reusable pieces.
# Key points:
    # A module is just a .py file.
    # You can import a module using the import statement.
    # Modules can contain functions, classes, or variables.
